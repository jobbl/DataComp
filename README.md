# DataComp

## First steps
- create script that downloads data (see datacomp website https://github.com/mlfoundations/dclm)
- get workspace on hpc (link here)
- try sum stuff :P
  - filtering track
    - how much filtering is already done? (e.g. html etc..)   
    - deduplication  
      - vector database
      - reduce computation by only comparing representatives
    - quality filtering
      - encoder model for filtering
        - train pretrained embedder + classifier on high/low quality data
        - reduce computation by only comparing representatives
      - embed mlu questions to query fitting data from vector db
  - mixing track
    - generate data
      - (maybe from mlu, but rephrased :P -> cheating? smart!)
